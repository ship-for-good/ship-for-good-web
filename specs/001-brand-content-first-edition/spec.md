# Spec: Brand & Content — 1st Edition

**Branch:** `001-brand-content-first-edition`
**Created:** 2026-04-10
**Status:** Draft

---

## Goal

Update the Ship For Good website so that all visible content — texts, logos, dates, and language options — reflect the official 1st edition of the event. Visitors should land on a page that accurately represents Ship For Good BCN 1ª Edición, including the partnership with Fundación Civio, the official tagline, and the correct event dates.

---

## Background

The current website is a fork of a generic base template. It contains placeholder content (incorrect dates, generic NGO references, no official logo, no Civio branding) and is missing English as a supported language. This feature brings the site up to date with the official communication kit before the event is publicly promoted.

## Out of Scope

- Connecting registration CTAs to a real URL (pending — separate task).
- Building new page sections not present in the current site.
- Changing the visual design system (colors, typography, layout structure).
- Any backend, form, or database work.
- Social media post publishing.

---

## Assumptions

- The official logo SVG provided by the user is final and approved for production use.
- Civio's logo is available on their public website in a format suitable for web use.
- The Catalan and English translations will be created by the development team based on the official Spanish kit — no separate translation review process is required before launch.
- The 42 Barcelona venue remains "edificio Telefónica" as in the current site.
- Specific schedule time slots for Day 1 and Day 2 beyond the start/end times will be inferred from the kit description and can be refined later.

---

## Success Criteria

1. All visible text on the page matches the official 1st edition communication kit.
2. The correct event dates (29–30 May 2026) appear consistently in every section.
3. Fundación Civio is presented as the partner organisation with their logo visible.
4. The page is fully readable in Spanish, Catalan, and English via the language toggle.
5. No placeholder or template content remains on the page (no "Tu logo aquí", no April 2025 dates, no generic NGO references).
6. The sponsors section does not appear on any language version of the page.
7. The official Ship For Good logo replaces any previous placeholder in the navbar.
